	<p>The Harkonnens have caught wind of the religious fervor spreading on Arrakis. Feyd-Rautha makes an attempt on his own uncle’s life. The Baron confronts him, interrogates him about the sham gladiator act, and decides to bargain with him. He determines to let Feyd-Rautha live, but humiliates him and kills off his minions in front of him to test if he will cut his losses. The Baron omits that Hawat tipped him off, and it is revealed that Hawat, knowing neither Harkonnen will admit to having been helped, plays both.</p>
<p>Paul, now 18 years old and father to a son with Chani, completes the ultimate Fremen test, and rides a giant Maker. Throughout the Fremen interactions there are murmurs about Paul’s sister Alia. She appears as a two year old child fully replete with all the memories of her Reverend Mother, and emotionally bonded to Jessica in a way that occasionally reaches a point of telepathy. Harah, Paul’s “ghanima” loves and protects the child from the fear and disgust of the sietch, and all three women contemplate whether Paul, a newly minted Sandrider, will challenge Stilgar for leadership.</p>
<p>Gurney and Paul reunite in battle with the words “You’ve no need of a knife with me, Gurney” as Gurney Halleck believes he is hallucinating his dead duke. Paul vocally regrets the loss of the carryall, and Gurney fully realizes that this is not his Duke, who was more concerned for the men. Chani and Gurney meet and Gurney watches the Fremen’s training combined with Paul’s battle tactics into a thing of power.</p>
<p>When ambushed by Sardaukar, concealed in Gurney’s troop, the Fremen suffer light casualties. Paul and Stilgar face each other after the confrontation with the Sardukar and announce that although the Fremen way of Succession involves bloodshed, so does the way of meeting offworlders. Stilgar saved Jessica and Paul, and Paul refuses deadly combat with him now from his own position of power. Ways change.</p>
