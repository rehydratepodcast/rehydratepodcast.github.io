	<h3>Episode 4</h3>
<p>Mike Evans meets Ye Wenjie in London in 1982. Ye Wenjie has made it out of Red Coast base and is a physics professor and Evans is running his father’s oil company. Ye reveals that she sent a message from Earth to the San Ti.</p>
<p>Wade tells Jin that she must go to the meetup that she was invited to to help catch the people that murdered Jack.</p>
<p>Shi tells Wade that they have found Evans on a boat called Judgement Day where we’re shown there is a full community with children in school.</p>
<p>Evans speaks with Sophon, who tells Evans that his enemies know about the meetup, but that they will protect them.</p>
<p>Da Shi speaks with his son about his future. His son tells him that he is going to be an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Evans tells Sophon the story of the Little Red Riding Hood. He tries to explain to them why the wolf in the story would lie about being the girl’s grandmother.</p>
<p>Sophon asks Evans if he has ever lied, he answers ruefully that he tries not to, but then soberly reflects that everyone does sometimes. Sophon pauses for a long time. The last communication she gives is to say “we cannot coexist with liars. We are afraid of you.” Afterwards, she falls silent.</p>
<p>Jin arrives at the meetup in the country where Tatiana tells her that the founder will be there tonight. To Jin’s great surprise the founder is introduced as Dr. Ye Wenjie</p>
<p>Ye gives a speech to the organization about how humanity cannot save themselves, but the San Ti will come to share their knowledge with them. Ye acknowledges that it will take 400 years, but ends by stating: they are coming.</p>
<p>The police break up the gathering. Ye tells the group not to resist, but Tatiana draws a gun, takes a shot and an armed fight ensues. Jin escapes, and Tatiana is subdued by Da Shi when he shoots her in the leg.</p>
<p>Will gets back home and looks at the book of Fairy Tales that was given to him by Jin. Still hiding his cancer diagnosis, he calls to tell her he’s going to rent a beach house and invites her. Hiding that she is in an ambulance escaping the chaos, she tells him about the history of the San Ti that she has learned so far.</p>
<p>Back in the 80’s, Ye Wenjie and Evans visit Judgement day. He shows her the communication that the San Ti have sent him. Evans tells her that she has brought them hope and they kiss.</p>
<p>In the present, Ye is brought back to London for questioning. Wade asks her what is so important about Judgement Day. Ye tells Wade that the San Ti are coming, and that there is nothing they can do to stop them.</p>
<h3>Episode 5</h3>
<p>After interviewing Ye Wenjie. Da Shi speaks with Wade and tries to think of a way to get the data off of Judgement day without giving the crew time to destroy the data. Da Shi tells Wade that Judgement Day booked a slot in the Panama Canal for next month.</p>
<p>Da Shi goes to see Auggie in their secluded location. He tells her that she needs to resume production on the nanofibers to help get the data from the people that killed Jack.</p>
<p>Auggie goes back to her office and tries to restart production. She is worried that as soon as she does the countdown will come back… but when she turns it on, she doesn’t see anything.</p>
<p>At the cottage, Will sits on the beach and gets a visit from Saul and Mr. Pugh, who tells Will that Jack has left him 20 million GBP.</p>
<p>On the day of the attack on Judgement Day, Wade, Auggie, and Raj are in the command center. As Judgement Day approaches the net, they watch as the ship starts to pass through the net of nanofibers. The horrific scene of people being sliced the net plays out before their eyes. Evans runs to the back of the ship to try to escape with the hard drive with the messages on it, but breaks his ankle and cannot escape as he is also caught by the nanofibers. The sliced ship runs aground.</p>
<p>Wade, Raj, and Auggie investigate the wreckage for any data that they can use. Wade finds the body of Evans and recovers the hard drive that he was holding.</p>
<p>Back in London, his team tries to decrypt the drive, but is not having any luck, but then the drive suddenly opens, with a mysterious file that is 102.31 PB called sophon.cxl</p>
<p>Wade speaks with Ye Wenjie and asks her why the San Ti allowed them to attack Judgement Day. Wade gives her a tape of Evans speaking with the San Ti abandoning Evans when they find they are afraid of them. Ye looks horrified but says nothing.</p>
<p>Jin and Wade return to London and view the file in the VR headsets. They encounter Sophon. Sophon tells them that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the San Ti race is doomed because due to having a stable planet, human civilization evolves at a much faster rate</li>
<li>In the 400 years that it takes them to get to Earth, the technological advantage will switch, so their plan is to block human science so it cannot advance.</li>
<li>The San-Ti used an unfolded 10-dimensional proton that they can imprint a computer on, refold it, send it to Earth at light speed, and then communicate at faster than light speed using quantum entanglement.</li>
<li>The sophons can cause “miracles” like the universe winking and the countdown, and most importantly, they’re always invisibly watching everything humanity does.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortly afterwards, across the world, every screen shows the same message “You Are Bugs.”</p>
<p>The sophon unfolds and shows everyone on Earth a reflection of themselves in the sky, and a giant eye appears to indicate that they are being watched.</p>
<p>In a remote village, Tatiana sees the eye in the sky and looks overjoyed.</p>
